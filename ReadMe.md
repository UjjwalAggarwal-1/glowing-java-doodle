-compile time polymorphism
-either have different return type or have different arguments, while the name is same

I appreciate the whole video, but there is a small mistake at 24:40 in function overloading. Return type is not a differentiating factor in polymorphism as compiler will not be able to differentiate (on the base of return type) which method is to be invoked if parameters/type/number/order are same. 
Kindly pin a comment or display a card to explain this. 

Inheritance
-inherit characteristic or function(viz method)
base class > sub-class
4 types in java
single level, multilevel, heiarchial, hybrid
5th type of inheritance: multiple inheritance in cpp, for one. implemented in interfaces in java, not in classes.
